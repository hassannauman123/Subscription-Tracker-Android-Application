# Parts of our project that have not been successful  
The amount of features we had for our app was less than what we would have liked (especially for the size of our team, as communicated on our feedback for iteration 2). Also, the work distribution may not have been entirely even. Only a few members had any git commits or merges for iteration 2. The same was true for project work that was not related to gitlab, like worksheets and documentation.
  
We also felt that overall communication was lacking. Communication from group members was sporadic. We also never had designated meeting times to come together as a group to work on the project and identify what is left to be done. 
  
Finally, another area that we identified that could be improved was reviewing our code before submission. We identified several errors and problems that could have been corrected had we implemented more rigorous code review practices.  


# Concretes Solutions with success metrics  
Our team had clear instructions at the beginning of the iteration that a few of us need to create a new issue for a feature in gitlab, along with a user story and dev tasks, and then implement that feature. If that happens we should see very clear evidence in gitlab metrics that the amount of people committing has increased, along with those new features being present in our project.
