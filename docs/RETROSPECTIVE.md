# Parts of our project that have not been successful
The amount of features we had for our app was less than what we would have liked (especially for the size of our team, as communicated on our feedback for iteration 2). Also, we did not feel like the work distribution amongst the team members was entirely even. Only a few members had any git commits or merges for iteration 2. The same was true for project work that was not related to gitlab.

# Concretes Solutions with success metrics
Our team had clear instructions at the beginning of the iteration that a few of us need to create a new issue for a feature in gitlab, along with a user story and dev tasks, and then implement that feature. If that happens we should see very clear evidence in gitlab metrics that the amount of people committing has increased, along with those new features being present in our project.
