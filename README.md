# Vision Statement

### Product name:  Track-It 


In a world with ever-increasing subscription services, Track-It is a powerful organizational tool to assist consumers with tracking and managing their subscriptions.


## What is Track it?
Users of Track-It will be able to add their subscriptions along with the subscription information and details. This might include things like service type and description, payment info, payment frequency and renewal date. Users will also be able to update the subscription information after it has been added. Track-It will securely save this information.

Track-It will provide users the ability to remove subscriptions. It will also allow users to cancel a subscription. This will greatly simplify the process of unsubscribing from a given service.

Track-It will allow the user to be able to see an overview of the costs involved from all of the services they are subscribed to. This feature will help the users get a firm grasp of all their recurring costs and allow them to more efficiently and effectively create and stick to a budget. The ability to visualize all subscriptions will also help users to decide if some services are not being utilized enough to justify the cost. A user will also be reminded when a payment is due, eliminating the risk of incurring late fees.

Track-It will also provide the ability for users to find new services they might be interested in and subscribed to those services. 


## Track-It's Value
Many consumers have multiple subscriptions, membership fees and other recurring payments like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Costco, gym memberships, parking lot permits, etc. It is easy to forget about all of these recurring subscriptions, and to not be fully aware of all of their costs. Track-It will help them remember those subscriptions by combining all of that information into one place, allowing users to see a detailed overview of all of their recurring expenses and manage their subscriptions in one convenient app.


## Who is Track-it for?
Track-It is primarily designed for consumers who have multiple paid subscriptions. It is also intended for those that are budget conscious and want an easier way to track their recurring expenses. 

## When will Track-It be successful?

Track-It will be considered a success if at least 40% of a specific target user (consumers with at least 4 paid subscriptions) who start using the system continue to use the system after 1 year, or we are able to generate $250,000+ from ad revenue per year.
