# Vision Statement

### Product name:  Track-It 


In a world with ever-increasing subscription services, Track-It is a powerful organizational tool to assist consumers with tracking and managing their subscriptions.


## What is Track it?
Track-It will allow users to create a user account so that any information they enter is securely saved and retrievable from multiple devices. Users will be able to save all of their subscriptions along with the subscription information and details. This includes the service type and description, the method of payment, cost per payment, payment frequency and renewal date. Users will also be able to edit the subscription information after it has been added. 

Removing subscriptions from the app will give the user the option to also cancel the subscription (ie, the user will no longer be charged a fee for the subscription). This will greatly simplify the process of unsubscribing from a given service. 

The user will be able to see the total costs involved from all of the services they are subscribed to. This information can be displayed in the form of daily, monthly and yearly total costs from all the subscriptions that they have. This feature will help the users get a firm grasp of all their recurring costs and allow them to more efficiently and effectively create and stick to a budget. The ability to visualize all subscriptions will also help users to decide if some services are not being utilized enough to justify the cost. A user will also be notified when a payment is due, eliminating the risk of incurring late fees. 

Track-It will also provide the ability for users to search for services they might be interested in where suggested partnered services will be displayed. Advertisements will also be provided that are relevant to the subscriptions a user currently has. 

## Track-It's Value
Many consumers have multiple subscriptions, membership fees and other recurring payments like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Costco, gym memberships, parking lot permits, etc. It is easy to forget about all of these recurring subscriptions, and to not be fully aware of all of their costs. Track-It will help them remember those subcripstions by combining all of that information into once place, allowing users to see a detailed overview of all of their recurring expenses and manage their subcriptions in one convenient app.


## Who is Track-it for?
Track-It is primarily designed for consumers who have multiple paid subscriptions. It is also intended for those that are budget conscious and want an easier way to track their recurring expenses. 

## When will Track-It be successful?

The subscription Tracker project will be considered a success if at least 40% of a specific target user (consumers with at least 4 paid subscriptions) who start using the system continue to use the system after 1 year, or we are able to generate $250,000+ from ad revenue per year.
